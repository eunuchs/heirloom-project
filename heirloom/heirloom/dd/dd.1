.SH NAME
dd \- convert and copy a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dd
[option=value] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Dd
copies the specified input file
to the specified output with
possible conversions.
The standard input and output are used by default.
The input and output block size may be
specified to take advantage of raw physical I/O.

.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI obs= n

.br
.ns
.TP 
.RI bs= n
set both input and output block size,
superseding

and

also, if no conversion is specified,
it is particularly efficient since no copy need be done

several comma-separated conversions
.PP
.fi
Where sizes are specified,
a number of bytes is expected.
A number may end with
.B "k, b"
or
.B w
to specify multiplication by
1024, 512, or 2 respectively;
a pair of numbers may be separated by
.B x
to indicate a product.
.PP
.I Cbs
is used only if
.IR ascii ,
.IR unblock,
.IR ebcdic ,
.IR ibm ,
or
.IR block
conversion is specified.
In the first two cases,
.I cbs
bytes are placed into the conversion buffer, converted to
ASCII, and trailing blanks trimmed and new-line added
before sending the line to the output.
In the latter three cases,
ASCII characters (bytes) are read into the
conversion buffer, converted to EBCDIC, and blanks added
to make up an
output record of size
.IR cbs .
.PP
Two additional values for the `conv'
option, `conv=idirect' and `conv=odirect',
are available as extensions.
They enable direct i/o on input or output, respectively.
See the description of the `O_DIRECT' flag in
.IR open (2)
for more information.
`conv=odirect' must be used with care
as it requires padding for correct operation;
a write that is not a multiple of an acceptable buffer size will fail.
This is particularly of concern for the last block written.
Using `conv=odirect' thus usually requires `conv=sync'
and cannot be used if such padding destroys the file integrity.
.PP
After completion,
.I dd
reports the number of whole and partial input and output
blocks.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
.BR LANG ", " LC_ALL
See
.IR locale (7).
.TP
.B LC_CTYPE
Determines the mapping of bytes to characters
for `conv=lcase' and `conv=ucase'.
.SH EXAMPLES
To read an EBCDIC tape blocked ten 80-byte
EBCDIC card images per record into the ASCII file
.IR x :
.IP ""
dd if=/dev/rmt0 of=x ibs=800 cbs=80 conv=ascii,lcase
.PP
Note the use of raw magtape.
.I Dd
is especially suited to I/O on the raw
physical devices because it allows reading
and writing in arbitrary record sizes.
.PP
To skip over a file before copying from magnetic tape do
.IP ""
(dd of=/dev/null; dd of=x) </dev/rmt0

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
f+p records in(out): numbers of full and partial records read(written)
.SH NOTES
The ASCII/EBCDIC conversion tables are
taken
.\" This was valid for v7/BSD conversion tables.
.\"from the 256 character standard in
.\"the CACM Nov, 1968.
.\" ***
.\" This is what various AT&T sources and mem(3) of libast say for the
.\" current tables. The tables itselves are given in the POSIX.2 rationale.
from a proposed BTL standard April 16, 1979.
The `ibm' conversion, while less blessed as a standard,
corresponds better to certain IBM print train conventions.
There is no universal solution.
.PP
When reading from pipes, FIFOs, character devices (e.\|g. terminals),
or network sockets,
partial input records can occur at any time
even before the end of the data stream is reached.
For the `count' option,
these are handled exactly like full records.
Using
.I dd
to retrieve exactly
.IR count * ibs
bytes from such files does thus not generally work unless `ibs=1'.
